🐠 @leomourap

Currently studying :chart: Data Science utilizing 🐍Python, with the goal of starting my career in the data/tech area.
Interested in organizing my portfolio with my projects and learn.


I have knowledge in Python language, as well as knowledge of the main Data Science libraries available in the language, such as 🐼Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, PyCaret, TensorFlow, etc. I also have basic understanding of BigData and SQL.

I have a lot of experience analyzing large data sets, but in an academic background, in the area of bioinformatics and genomics.

I've worked routinely with the treatment and analysis of massive genetic sequencing data from organisms, in search of meaningful and useful results to answer existing problematics (in some evolutionary context). I've ran some analyses workflows and sometimes i wrote small Python programs to automatize the process and analyze phases of some data (e.g. GFF-extractor, available here in my github repositories).

I consider myself a person with good analytical skills. I always try to be proactive and to have autonomy while solving problems I encounter in my daily work routine and also while learning new tools or analyses techniques.

If you wanna contact me, you can send me an email at 📫 leomgiglio94@gmail.com
