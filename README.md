🐠 @leomourap

Currently studying :chart: Data Science utilizing 🐍Python, with the goal of starting my career in the data/tech area.
Interested in organizing my portfolio with my projects and learn.


I have knowledge in Python language, as well as knowledge of the main Data Science tools available in the language, such as 🐼Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, besides basic knowledge in scikit-learn.
I also have a lot of experience analyzing large data sets, but in an academic/genomic background.

I still continue my research remotely at the Fish Genetics Lab at UNESP Bauru in the Genomics and Bioinformatics fields.
I work routinely with the treatment and analysis of massive genetic sequencing data from organisms, in search of meaningful and useful results to answer existing problems in some evolutionary context. I run some analyses workflows and sometimes i write small programs to process and analyze the data with Python (e.g. GFF-extractor, available here in my github repositories).

I consider myself a person with good analytical skills. I always try to be proactive and to have autonomy while solving problems I encounter in my daily work routine and also while learning new tools or analyses techniques.

If you wanna contact me, you can send me an email at 📫 leomgiglio94@gmail.com
